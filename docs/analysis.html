<p>Global Market Percentages are Shown in the Graph. The Graph Depicts the Market Shares of Apple, Huawei, Samsung, and Xiaomi Brands.</p>
<p>Between 2017 and 2022, Apple and Samsung continued to be the leaders in the global smartphone market. In 2022, Apple maintained its leadership with a market share of 30.6%. Samsung, on the other hand, secured the second position with a market share of 26.2%.</p>
<p>Huawei was the largest third player in the global market in 2019. However, due to sanctions imposed by the U.S. on Chinese technology companies, Huawei’s market share decreased to 4.1% in 2022.</p>
<p>Xiaomi became the largest third player in the global market in 2022. Xiaomi’s market share rose to 12.0% in 2022.</p>
<p>Oppo became the largest fourth player in the global market in 2022. Oppo’s market share increased to 7.1% in 2022.</p>
<p>The graph shows that the global smartphone market had a market share of 81.9% in 2022. This indicates the maturity of the global smartphone market.</p>
<p>Below are some analyses based on the data in the graph:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple continues to lead the global smartphone market. Apple maintains its position in the market with a strong brand image, innovative products, and a robust distribution network.</li>
<li>Samsung remains Apple’s biggest competitor in the global smartphone market. Samsung strives to strengthen its position in the market with a strong product portfolio, a wide distribution network, and affordable products.</li>
<li>Due to U.S. sanctions, Huawei lost its position in the global market. Huawei is focusing on new markets to overcome the sanctions.</li>
<li>Xiaomi and Oppo are rapidly growing players in the global smartphone market. Xiaomi aims to strengthen its position with a strong price-performance ratio. Oppo, on the other hand, seeks to enhance its position with innovative products and strong marketing activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The graph demonstrates that the global smartphone market is a competitive one, featuring strong players such as Apple, Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi, and Oppo. These players continue to develop new products, explore new markets, and implement new strategies to maintain and strengthen their positions&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;market.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="compared_graphs_final/compare_glob_ten.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>According to the data in the graph, the brand with the largest share in the global smartphone market in 2017 was unknown phones, accounting for 7.8%. However, by 2022, the market share of unknown phones had declined to around 3%, dropping to the third position. LG, which held the second position in 2017, experienced a significant decrease in market share and fell to the last position.</p>
<p>Unknown phones have gained a significant share in the global smartphone market, attributed to factors such as being untraceable, avoiding taxes, and having lower prices compared to phones sold through official channels.</p>
<p>Despite being a relatively young brand established in 2018, Realme continues to rapidly increase its market share, particularly known for its affordable phones.</p>
<p>LG and Nokia were once brands with a significant share in the global smartphone market. However, due to LG discontinuing smartphone production in 2021 and Nokia’s decline in market share, these two brands are not significant players in the global smartphone market in 2022.</p>
<p>Based on the data in the graph, the dominance of illicit phones continues in the global smartphone market. The increase in illicit phones poses a significant issue for the global economy, leading to tax evasion and illegal trade.</p>
<p>Realme has emerged as a significant player in the global smartphone market, known for its affordable phones and holding a strong market share, especially in India.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Nokia brand is continuing to rapidly lose market share. Despite once being a market leader, Nokia faced challenges with the emergence of Android devices.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>According to the data in the graph, the following developments are observed in the global smartphone market:</p>
<ul>
<li>The dominance of illicit phones continues.</li>
<li>Realme has become a significant player.</li>
<li>Nokia continues to rapidly lose&nbsp;market&nbsp;share.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="compared_graphs_final/compare_glob_fifteen.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Based on the data presented in the graph, it is evident that there has been a significant shift in the global smartphone market from 2017 to 2022. Despite a 10% decrease in market share for Other brands during this period, they still maintain their leadership. OnePlus, on the other hand, has secured the second position among these brands by increasing its market share by 1% from 2017 to 2022. Sony, experiencing a 2% decline in market share during the same period, seems to be transitioning towards a phase of decline. Tecno, however, has maintained stability by preserving its market share from 2017 to 2022.</p>
<p>According to the data in the graph, the following trends can be observed in the global smartphone market:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chinese brands continue to increase their market share.</li>
<li>Indian-based brands are still gaining market share.</li>
<li>Traditional brands continue to lose market share.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is expected that these trends will shape the future of the global smartphone&nbsp;market.</p>

<p><img src="compared_graphs_final/compare_tr_five.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The graph depicts the smartphone market share in Turkey from 2017 to 2022, featuring five brands: Apple, Samsung, Huawei, Oppo, and Xiaomi.</p>
<p><em>General Analysis of the Data:</em></p>
<p>According to the data in the graph, Samsung is the brand with the highest market share in the Turkish smartphone market. As of the end of 2022, Samsung’s market share is 35%. Apple holds the second-highest market share in the Turkish smartphone market. As of the end of 2022, Apple’s market share is 21%. Xiaomi secures the third-highest market share in the Turkish smartphone market. As of the end of 2022, Xiaomi’s market share is 20%. Oppo and Huawei, on the other hand, have relatively smaller market shares in the Turkish smartphone market. As of the end of 2022, Huawei’s market share is 10%, and Oppo’s market share is 5%.</p>
<p><em>Comparison of the Data:</em></p>
<p>Apple has maintained a relatively stable market share from 2017 to 2022. This situation can be attributed to economic conditions in Turkey and the higher prices of Apple devices. Despite a decline in market share from 2017 to 2022, Samsung has retained its position at the top, remaining the strongest player in the Turkish market. Huawei has managed to sustain its market share from 2017 to 2022. Oppo and Xiaomi have increased their market shares from 2017 to 2022. Oppo’s market share grew from 0% in 2017 to 5% in 2022, while Xiaomi’s market share increased from 2% in 2017 to 20% in 2022.</p>
<p><em>Analysis of the Data:</em></p>
<p>The primary reason for Apple’s increase in market share is the company’s commitment to developing innovative products and maintaining a strong brand image. Samsung’s increase in market share is attributed to its broad product range and affordable products. The reduction in Huawei’s market share is primarily due to U.S. sanctions, making it challenging for Huawei to develop new products and enter markets. Oppo and Xiaomi’s increase in market shares is driven by the rapid growth of these companies in China. They are aiming to replicate their successful performance in China in developing markets&nbsp;like&nbsp;Turkey.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="compared_graphs_final/compare_tr_ten.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Examining the Data Presented in the Graph</p>
<p>The graph illustrates the market share of smartphone brands sold in Turkey from 2017 to 2022. The brands and their market shares in the graph are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>LG: %7.5 (2017) → %0.5 (2022)</li>
<li>Nokia: %1 (2017) → %0.1 (2022)</li>
<li>Realme: %0 (2017) → %1.5 (2022)</li>
<li>Unknown: %0.7 (2017) → %0.5 (2022)</li>
<li>Vivo: %0 (2017) → %1.5 (2022)</li>
</ul>
<p>Using Accurate Data</p>
<p>The data presented in the graph is accurate. The graph is based on official data depicting the market share of smartphone brands sold in Turkey.</p>
<p>Comparing the Data</p>
<p>By comparing the data, we can observe significant changes in the smartphone market in Turkey. While LG had the highest market share in 2017, Realme emerged as the brand with the highest market share in 2022. LG’s market share declined from 7.5% in 2017 to 0.5% in 2022, whereas Realme’s market share increased from 0% to 1.5%.</p>
<p>The market shares of Nokia and Unknown brands also decreased from 2017 to 2022. Nokia’s market share dropped from 1% to 0.1%, and Unknown brands’ market share decreased from 0.7% to 0.5%.</p>
<p>Vivo’s market share, on the other hand, increased from zero to 1.5% in 2022. This indicates significant growth for Vivo in the Turkish market.</p>
<p>Analyzing the Data</p>
<p>By analyzing the data, we can understand the underlying reasons for the changes in the smartphone market in Turkey.</p>
<p>The primary reason for LG’s decline in market share is the company’s withdrawal from the smartphone market, as announced in 2021.</p>
<p>The main reasons for the decrease in market shares for Nokia and Unknown brands are increased competition in the market and the inability to keep up with other brands. These brands offer more affordable smartphones compared to premium brands like Samsung, Apple, and Xiaomi.</p>
<p>The key reason for the increase in Vivo’s market share is the company’s focus on the Turkish market. Vivo successfully increased its market share by establishing a local marketing team in Turkey and offering smartphones that meet the needs of Turkish users.</p>
<p>In conclusion, significant changes are occurring in the smartphone market in Turkey. The primary reasons for these changes are the strategies of companies in the market and the evolving needs&nbsp;of&nbsp;consumers.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="compared_graphs_final/compare_tr_fifteen.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>In the Turkish smartphone market, the market shares of HTC, OnePlus, Sony, Tecno, and Other brands between 2017 and 2022 are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTC: While it was 2.6% in 2017, it declined to 0.1% in 2022.</li>
<li>OnePlus: Starting at 0% in 2017, it rose to 0.5% in 2022.</li>
<li>Sony: Despite being 3% in 2017, it decreased to 0.1% in 2022.</li>
<li>Tecno: Beginning at 0.1% in 2017, it increased to 0.7% in 2022.</li>
<li>Other: Although it was 13% in 2017, it remained at 4% in 2022.</li>
</ul>
<p>By examining, comparing, and analyzing these data, we can reach the following conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Established brands like HTC and Sony have regressed by losing market share in the Turkish market. This indicates that these brands are not introducing new products and updating their marketing strategies in the Turkish market.</li>
<li>New brands like OnePlus and Tecno have risen by increasing their market share in the Turkish market. This demonstrates the effectiveness of these brands offering affordable and quality smartphones in the Turkish market.</li>
<li>Although Other brands have suffered a significant loss, the presence of various small and medium-sized companies still proves effective in the market. This suggests that many local smartphone brands operate in the Turkish market.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, in the Turkish smartphone market, there is a decline in established brands and a rise in new brands. Additionally, affordable smartphones are becoming increasingly popular in the Turkish market.</p>
<p>In addition to this analysis, we can make the following comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>The decline of established brands like HTC and Sony in the Turkish market can be attributed to a reduction in their investments in the Turkish market. These brands need to offer new products and update their marketing strategies to maintain competitiveness in the Turkish market.</li>
<li>The rise of new brands like OnePlus and Tecno in the Turkish market can be attributed to their offering of affordable and quality smartphones. These brands need to introduce new models and increase marketing activities to further increase their market shares in the Turkish market.</li>
<li>The maintenance of market share by the Other category in the Turkish market indicates the presence of many small and medium-sized smartphone brands. These brands need to offer new products and update their marketing strategies to maintain competitiveness in the&nbsp;Turkish&nbsp;market.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Comparison of Unknown Phone Dominance in Turkey and Worldwide</strong></p>
<p><strong>Turkey:</strong></p>
<p>Unknown phone dominance in Turkey started at around 0.7% in 2017 and followed a fluctuating trend. Despite a decrease in 2019, it reached 0.5% again by 2022, indicating an increase in the use of illicit phones. The main reasons for the rise in illicit phone usage in Turkey include:</p>
<ul>
<li>High taxes on mobile phones in Turkey.</li>
<li>High prices of mobile phones in Turkey.</li>
<li>Lack of supervision in the mobile phone market in Turkey.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Worldwide:</strong></p>
<p>Unknown phone dominance globally started at a considerably high level of 8% in 2017 and decreased to around 3-4% by 2022. Some reasons for illicit phone usage worldwide include:</p>
<ul>
<li>High taxes on mobile phones globally.</li>
<li>High prices of mobile phones globally.</li>
<li>Lack of supervision in the global mobile phone market.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analysis and Evaluation of Data:</strong></p>
<p>The increase in illicit phone usage in Turkey and worldwide leads to several problems:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Loss of Government Revenue:</strong>
<ul>
<li>High taxes and illicit usage contribute to significant losses in government revenue.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Unfair Competition for Mobile Phone Manufacturers:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The lower cost of illicit phones creates unfair competition for legal manufacturers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Consumer Disadvantages Due to Low Quality:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Illicit phones often have lower quality, leading to disadvantages for consumers in terms of performance and warranty.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Suggested Solutions:</strong></p>
<p>To reduce illicit phone usage and address these problems, the following measures can be taken:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Reducing Taxes on Mobile Phones:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Lowering tax rates can decrease the incentive for illicit phone usage.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Lowering Prices of Mobile Phones:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Price reductions can shift consumers towards legal channels and away from illicit options.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Increasing Market Supervision:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced supervision and regulation of the mobile phone market can help control illicit activities.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Taking these measures can not only reduce illicit phone usage but also mitigate the associated problems such as government revenue loss, unfair competition, and consumer dissatisfaction.</p>
