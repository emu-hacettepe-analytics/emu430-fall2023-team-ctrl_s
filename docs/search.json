Aykut Şimşek\nAkif Bora Eren\nBaran Can Şahin\nSerhat Kaya\nSüleyman Çelik\n\n\n\nProject Topic\nMobile communication technologies have rapidly evolved into a thriving industry, becoming one of the world’s largest markets. In this context, the widespread use of mobile devices globally has created a competitive market, compelling companies to race to expand their shares. Simultaneously, the internal dynamics and market characteristics of each country play crucial roles in shaping the market shares of mobile vendors.\nIn this project, we will examine the differences between the global market shares of mobile vendors and those in Turkey, along with the underlying reasons for these differences. Firstly, we will seek to understand how mobile market shares are distributed worldwide. Subsequently, we will shift our focus to Turkey, analyzing the dynamics of mobile vendors’ market shares in this country.\nThis analysis will also evaluate technological trends, consumer behaviors, and current industry developments. The findings obtained will shed valuable light on determining the competitive advantages of mobile vendors globally and in Turkey, shaping their strategies for the future.\n\n\nData Sets\nData Set – 1 : Mobile Vendor Market Share Worldwide (April 2017 - April 2023)\nData Set – 2 : Mobile Vendor Market Share in Turkey (April 2017 - April 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n” B İ R S A A T L İ K İ Ş İ M İ Z K A L D I . . . .”\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Both graphs illustrate an upward trend in Samsung’s market share over time. However, it’s important to note that Samsung’s dominance in the Turkish market is significantly lower compared to its global dominance.\n\nSamsung’s Dominance in the Turkish Market\nSamsung’s market share in Turkey has risen from 20% in 2010 to 40% in 2022.

This further demonstrates the company’s strong position in the global market, solidifying its position as the leading smartphone manufacturer.\n\n\nDetailed Analysis\nSeveral factors could contribute to the disparity between Samsung’s Turkish and global market dominance:\n* The Turkish market is significantly smaller than the global market.\n* Turkey boasts a number of strong local brands competing against Samsung.\n* Smartphone prices in Turkey are generally higher compared to the global market.\nThese factors likely contribute to a less competitive environment for Samsung within the Turkish market.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe graphs reveal a consistent increase in Samsung’s market share in both Turkey and the global market. However, it’s evident that Samsung’s dominance in the Turkish market falls behind its global dominance.
