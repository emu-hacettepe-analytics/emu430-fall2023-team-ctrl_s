In this context, the widespread use of mobile devices globally has created a competitive market, compelling companies to race to expand their shares. Simultaneously, the internal dynamics and market characteristics of each country play crucial roles in shaping the market shares of mobile vendors.\nIn this project, we will examine the differences between the global market shares of mobile vendors and those in Turkey, along with the underlying reasons for these differences. Firstly, we will seek to understand how mobile market shares are distributed worldwide. Subsequently, we will shift our focus to Turkey, analyzing the dynamics of mobile vendors’ market shares in this country.\nThis analysis will also evaluate technological trends, consumer behaviors, and current industry developments. The findings obtained will shed valuable light on determining the competitive advantages of mobile vendors globally and in Turkey, shaping their strategies for the future.\n\n\nData Sets\nData Set – 1 : Mobile Vendor Market Share Worldwide (April 2017 - April 2023)\nData Set – 2 : Mobile Vendor Market Share in Turkey (April 2017 - April 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n” B İ R S A A T L İ K İ Ş İ M İ Z K A L D I . . . .”\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

The Graph Depicts the Market Shares of Apple, Huawei, Samsung, and Xiaomi Brands.\nBetween 2017 and 2022, Apple and Samsung continued to be the leaders in the global smartphone market. In 2022, Apple maintained its leadership with a market share of 30.6%. Samsung, on the other hand, secured the second position with a market share of 26.2%.\nHuawei was the largest third player in the global market in 2019. However, due to sanctions imposed by the U.S. on Chinese technology companies, Huawei’s market share decreased to 4.1% in 2022.\nXiaomi became the largest third player in the global market in 2022. Xiaomi’s market share rose to 12.0% in 2022.\nOppo became the largest fourth player in the global market in 2022. Oppo’s market share increased to 7.1% in 2022.\nThe graph shows that the global smartphone market had a market share of 81.9% in 2022. This indicates the maturity of the global smartphone market.\nBelow are some analyses based on the data in the graph:\n\nApple continues to lead the global smartphone market. Apple maintains its position in the market with a strong brand image, innovative products, and a robust distribution network.\nSamsung remains Apple’s biggest competitor in the global smartphone market. Samsung strives to strengthen its position in the market with a strong product portfolio, a wide distribution network, and affordable products.\nDue to U.S. sanctions, Huawei lost its position in the global market. Huawei is focusing on new markets to overcome the sanctions.\nXiaomi and Oppo are rapidly growing players in the global smartphone market. Xiaomi aims to strengthen its position with a strong price-performance ratio. Oppo, on the other hand, seeks to enhance its position with innovative products and strong marketing activities.\n\nThe graph demonstrates that the global smartphone market is a competitive one, featuring strong players such as Apple, Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi, and Oppo. These players continue to develop new products, explore new markets, and implement new strategies to maintain and strengthen their positions in the market.\n\n\nAccording to the data in the graph, the brand with the largest share in the global smartphone market in 2017 was unknown phones, accounting for 7.8%. However, by 2022, the market share of unknown phones had declined to around 3%, dropping to the third position. LG, which held the second position in 2017, experienced a significant decrease in market share and fell to the last position.\nUnknown phones have gained a significant share in the global smartphone market, attributed to factors such as being untraceable, avoiding taxes, and having lower prices compared to phones sold through official channels.\nDespite being a relatively young brand established in 2018, Realme continues to rapidly increase its market share, particularly known for its affordable phones.\nLG and Nokia were once brands with a significant share in the global smartphone market. However, due to LG discontinuing smartphone production in 2021 and Nokia’s decline in market share, these two brands are not significant players in the global smartphone market in 2022.\nBased on the data in the graph, the dominance of illicit phones continues in the global smartphone market. The increase in illicit phones poses a significant issue for the global economy, leading to tax evasion and illegal trade.\nRealme has emerged as a significant player in the global smartphone market, known for its affordable phones and holding a strong market share, especially in India.\nOn the other hand, the Nokia brand is continuing to rapidly lose market share. Despite once being a market leader, Nokia faced challenges with the emergence of Android devices.\nConclusion\nAccording to the data in the graph, the following developments are observed in the global smartphone market:\n\nThe dominance of illicit phones continues.\nRealme has become a significant player.\nNokia continues to rapidly lose market share.\n\n\n\nBased on the data presented in the graph, it is evident that there has been a significant shift in the global smartphone market from 2017 to 2022. Despite a 10% decrease in market share for Other brands during this period, they still maintain their leadership. OnePlus, on the other hand, has secured the second position among these brands by increasing its market share by 1% from 2017 to 2022. Sony, experiencing a 2% decline in market share during the same period, seems to be transitioning towards a phase of decline. Tecno, however, has maintained stability by preserving its market share from 2017 to 2022.\nAccording to the data in the graph, the following trends can be observed in the global smartphone market:\n\nChinese brands continue to increase their market share.\nIndian-based brands are still gaining market share.\nTraditional brands continue to lose market share.\n\nIt is expected that these trends will shape the future of the global smartphone market.\n\n\nThe graph depicts the smartphone market share in Turkey from 2017 to 2022, featuring five brands: Apple, Samsung, Huawei, Oppo, and Xiaomi.\nGeneral Analysis of the Data:\nAccording to the data in the graph, Samsung is the brand with the highest market share in the Turkish smartphone market. As of the end of 2022, Samsung’s market share is 35%. Apple holds the second-highest market share in the Turkish smartphone market. As of the end of 2022, Apple’s market share is 21%. Xiaomi secures the third-highest market share in the Turkish smartphone market. As of the end of 2022, Xiaomi’s market share is 20%. Oppo and Huawei, on the other hand, have relatively smaller market shares in the Turkish smartphone market. As of the end of 2022, Huawei’s market share is 10%, and Oppo’s market share is 5%.\nComparison of the Data:\nApple has maintained a relatively stable market share from 2017 to 2022. This situation can be attributed to economic conditions in Turkey and the higher prices of Apple devices. Despite a decline in market share from 2017 to 2022, Samsung has retained its position at the top, remaining the strongest player in the Turkish market. Huawei has managed to sustain its market share from 2017 to 2022. Oppo and Xiaomi have increased their market shares from 2017 to 2022. Oppo’s market share grew from 0% in 2017 to 5% in 2022, while Xiaomi’s market share increased from 2% in 2017 to 20% in 2022.\nAnalysis of the Data:\nThe primary reason for Apple’s increase in market share is the company’s commitment to developing innovative products and maintaining a strong brand image. Samsung’s increase in market share is attributed to its broad product range and affordable products. The reduction in Huawei’s market share is primarily due to U.S. sanctions, making it challenging for Huawei to develop new products and enter markets. Oppo and Xiaomi’s increase in market shares is driven by the rapid growth of these companies in China. They are aiming to replicate their successful performance in China in developing markets like Turkey.\n\n\nExamining the Data Presented in the Graph\nThe graph illustrates the market share of smartphone brands sold in Turkey from 2017 to 2022. The brands and their market shares in the graph are as follows:\n\nLG: %7.5 (2017) → %0.5 (2022)\nNokia: %1 (2017) → %0.1 (2022)\nRealme: %0 (2017) → %1.5 (2022)\nUnknown: %0.7 (2017) → %0.5 (2022)\nVivo: %0 (2017) → %1.5 (2022)\n\nUsing Accurate Data\nThe data presented in the graph is accurate. The graph is based on official data depicting the market share of smartphone brands sold in Turkey.\nComparing the Data\nBy comparing the data, we can observe significant changes in the smartphone market in Turkey. While LG had the highest market share in 2017, Realme emerged as the brand with the highest market share in 2022. LG’s market share declined from 7.5% in 2017 to 0.5% in 2022, whereas Realme’s market share increased from 0% to 1.5%.\nThe market shares of Nokia and Unknown brands also decreased from 2017 to 2022. Nokia’s market share dropped from 1% to 0.1%, and Unknown brands’ market share decreased from 0.7% to 0.5%.\nVivo’s market share, on the other hand, increased from zero to 1.5% in 2022. This indicates significant growth for Vivo in the Turkish market.\nAnalyzing the Data\nBy analyzing the data, we can understand the underlying reasons for the changes in the smartphone market in Turkey.\nThe primary reason for LG’s decline in market share is the company’s withdrawal from the smartphone market, as announced in 2021.\nThe main reasons for the decrease in market shares for Nokia and Unknown brands are increased competition in the market and the inability to keep up with other brands. These brands offer more affordable smartphones compared to premium brands like Samsung, Apple, and Xiaomi.\nThe key reason for the increase in Vivo’s market share is the company’s focus on the Turkish market. Vivo successfully increased its market share by establishing a local marketing team in Turkey and offering smartphones that meet the needs of Turkish users.\nIn conclusion, significant changes are occurring in the smartphone market in Turkey. The primary reasons for these changes are the strategies of companies in the market and the evolving needs of consumers.\n\n\nIn the Turkish smartphone market, the market shares of HTC, OnePlus, Sony, Tecno, and Other brands between 2017 and 2022 are as follows:\n\nHTC: While it was 2.6% in 2017, it declined to 0.1% in 2022.\nOnePlus: Starting at 0% in 2017, it rose to 0.5% in 2022.\nSony: Despite being 3% in 2017, it decreased to 0.1% in 2022.\nTecno: Beginning at 0.1% in 2017, it increased to 0.7% in 2022.\nOther: Although it was 13% in 2017, it remained at 4% in 2022.\n\nBy examining, comparing, and analyzing these data, we can reach the following conclusions:\n\nEstablished brands like HTC and Sony have regressed by losing market share in the Turkish market. This indicates that these brands are not introducing new products and updating their marketing strategies in the Turkish market.\nNew brands like OnePlus and Tecno have risen by increasing their market share in the Turkish market. This demonstrates the effectiveness of these brands offering affordable and quality smartphones in the Turkish market.\nAlthough Other brands have suffered a significant loss, the presence of various small and medium-sized companies still proves effective in the market. This suggests that many local smartphone brands operate in the Turkish market.\n\nIn conclusion, in the Turkish smartphone market, there is a decline in established brands and a rise in new brands. Additionally, affordable smartphones are becoming increasingly popular in the Turkish market.\nIn addition to this analysis, we can make the following comments:\n\nThe decline of established brands like HTC and Sony in the Turkish market can be attributed to a reduction in their investments in the Turkish market. These brands need to offer new products and update their marketing strategies to maintain competitiveness in the Turkish market.\nThe rise of new brands like OnePlus and Tecno in the Turkish market can be attributed to their offering of affordable and quality smartphones. These brands need to introduce new models and increase marketing activities to further increase their market shares in the Turkish market.\nThe maintenance of market share by the Other category in the Turkish market indicates the presence of many small and medium-sized smartphone brands. These brands need to offer new products and update their marketing strategies to maintain competitiveness in the Turkish market."

Both graphs illustrate an upward trend in Samsung’s market share over time. However, it’s important to note that Samsung’s dominance in the Turkish market is significantly lower compared to its global dominance.\n\nSamsung’s Dominance in the Turkish Market\nSamsung’s market share in Turkey has risen from 20% in 2010 to 40% in 2022. This signifies a strengthening position for Samsung within the Turkish market. However, the gap between Samsung’s share in Turkey and globally remains substantial.\n\n\nSamsung’s Dominance in the Global Market\nGlobally, Samsung’s market share has increased from 40% in 2010 to 60% in 2022. This further demonstrates the company’s strong position in the global market, solidifying its position as the leading smartphone manufacturer.\n\n\nDetailed Analysis\nSeveral factors could contribute to the disparity between Samsung’s Turkish and global market dominance:\n* The Turkish market is significantly smaller than the global market.\n* Turkey boasts a number of strong local brands competing against Samsung.\n* Smartphone prices in Turkey are generally higher compared to the global market.\nThese factors likely contribute to a less competitive environment for Samsung within the Turkish market.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe graphs reveal a consistent increase in Samsung’s market share in both Turkey and the global market. However, it’s evident that Samsung’s dominance in the Turkish market falls behind its global dominance. This disparity can be attributed to various factors like market size, competition landscape, and price levels."

This decrease indicates increased competition in the market, with smaller brands struggling to maintain their share.\nDespite the decline in the market share of “other brands,” it is well-known that local brands play a significant role, especially in the local market.

It declined to 2.4% in 2018, 1.5% in 2019, 1.5% in 2020, 1% in 2021, and further dropped to 0.2% in 2022. This decline suggests that Sony is withdrawing from the Turkish market.\n\n\nDominance in the Global Market\nIn the global market, Sony’s dominance was 2.5% in 2017. It decreased to 2% in 2018, 1.5% in 2019, 1% in 2020, 0.5% in 2021, and reached 0.2% in 2022. This decline indicates increased competition in the global market.\n\n\n\nComparison\nIn terms of dominance in both the Turkish and global markets, Sony’s performance is similar. In both markets, Sony’s dominance is decreasing.\n\n\nAnalysis\nThe decline in Sony’s dominance in both Turkish and global markets can be attributed to several reasons. Firstly, increased competition in the technology sector is causing Sony to lose market share. Secondly, Sony’s success in developing innovative products has slowed down. Thirdly, Sony’s global distribution network is struggling to compete with the distribution networks of its rivals.\nThe decrease in Sony’s dominance in Turkish and global markets is not indicative of the company’s future success. If Sony cannot address the factors contributing to this decline, there is a risk of further loss in market share."

However, it appears that OnePlus did not achieve the targeted growth in the Turkish market.\nOn the global stage, OnePlus had a 0.2% market share in 2017, which rose to 1.5% by 2022. OnePlus continues to experience growth in the global market.\n\n\nComparison\nThe dominance of OnePlus globally is growing at a faster rate compared to its presence in Turkey. This indicates that OnePlus has more potential and appeal on a worldwide scale.\n\n\nAnalysis\nSeveral factors contribute to OnePlus’s global growth. Firstly, OnePlus is known for offering affordable yet high-quality smartphones. Secondly, OnePlus has a robust marketing campaign. Thirdly, OnePlus benefits from the increasing demand for smartphones in both the Turkish and global markets.\nThe expansion of OnePlus is positive news for both the Turkish and global smartphone markets. OnePlus’s growth is expected to enhance competition and provide consumers with more choices.

    "text": "HTC \n\n\nHTC’s Market Dominance in Turkey and Globally: A Comparative Analysis\nBetween 2017 and 2022, HTC held a significant share in the Turkish smartphone market. In 2017, HTC’s market share in Turkey was 2.5%, which declined to 0.1% by 2022. The decrease in HTC’s market share in Turkey can be attributed to the company’s withdrawal from the Turkish market, increased competition from rival firms, and HTC’s failure to innovate successfully.\nOn a global scale, HTC also experienced a decline in market share from 2.2% in 2017 to 0.1% by 2022. The global decline in HTC’s market share can be explained by intensified competition from rival firms and HTC’s lack of success in developing innovative products.\n\n\nComparison\nThere are some similarities in HTC’s dominance in both the Turkish and global markets. In both markets, HTC’s market share decreased from 2017 to 2022.\nHowever, there are significant differences between the two markets. The more pronounced decline in Turkey suggests that HTC is less competitive in the Turkish market compared to the global market.\n\n\nAnalysis\nThe decline in HTC’s market dominance in Turkey and globally raises significant concerns for the company’s future. To counteract this decline, HTC should focus on developing innovative products and enhancing competitiveness against rival firms.\nIncreasing Research and Development (R&D) investments could allow HTC to develop innovative products that stand out in the market. Additionally, expanding into new markets may help HTC increase its competitiveness against rival firms.\nBy taking these measures, HTC can regain its market dominance in both the Turkish and global markets. Adopting a proactive approach to innovation and market expansion will be crucial for HTC’s future success."

This figure dwindled to 0.1% by 2022. Among the primary reasons for this decline are heightened competition, emerging technological advancements, and changes in Nokia’s marketing strategy.\n\n\nNokia’s Dominance in the Global Market\nIn 2017, Nokia held 2.5% of the market share globally. By 2022, this figure had decreased to 0.5%. Similar to the Turkish market, increased competition, evolving technological trends, and alterations in Nokia’s marketing strategy contributed to this decline.\n\n\n\nComparison\nWhen comparing the decline in dominance in Turkish and global markets, it is evident that the drop was more dramatic globally. This could be attributed to the broader scope of the global mobile market. In Turkey, other major manufacturers like Samsung, Huawei, and Apple also hold a significant market share.\n\n\nAnalysis\nThe decline in Nokia’s market share signals the company’s loss of competitiveness in the global mobile market. To overcome this decline, Nokia should focus on developing new strategies and restructuring its marketing activities. Adopting innovative approaches and adapting to changing market dynamics will be crucial for Nokia’s resurgence in both Turkish and global markets."

This growth indicates Tecno’s successful efforts in expanding its market share in Turkey. Key factors contributing to Tecno’s increased market share include offering budget-friendly and high-quality smartphone models, conducting robust marketing campaigns, and expanding distribution channels in Turkey.\nOn the global stage, Tecno’s dominance also witnessed substantial growth, rising from 0.2% in 2017 to 1.5% in 2022. This demonstrates Tecno’s emergence as a noteworthy player in the global market. The primary reasons behind Tecno’s global dominance include capitalizing on the growing demand for low-cost smartphones and accelerating its growth in developing markets such as Asia and Africa.\n\n\nComparison\nWhile Tecno’s dominance in Turkey is lower than its global presence, the rate of growth in Turkey surpasses that on the global scale. This suggests that Tecno has higher potential to increase its market share in Turkey.\n\n\nAnalysis\nThe increasing dominance of Tecno in both Turkish and global markets signifies the company’s pivotal role in the smartphone industry. To sustain this success, Tecno must continue to offer budget-friendly and high-quality smartphone models, execute strong marketing campaigns, and expand distribution channels.\n\n\nRecommendations\nTo enhance Tecno’s dominance in both the Turkish and global markets, the following recommendations can be considered:\n1- Develop a Targeted Strategy for Turkey:\n   - Create a specific strategy for increasing market share in Turkey.\n   - Focus on providing budget-friendly and high-quality smartphone models, conducting robust marketing campaigns, and expanding distribution channels.\n2- Accelerate Growth in Developing Markets:\n   - Concentrate on developing markets such as Asia and Africa to accelerate global growth.\n3- Invest in Research and Development:\n   - Allocate resources to research and development to stay abreast of new technologies and industry trends.\nBy implementing these recommendations, Tecno can solidify its position in both the Turkish and global smartphone markets and continue its upward trajectory in market dominance."

Despite a decrease in 2019, it reached 0.5% again by 2022, indicating an increase in the use of illicit phones. The main reasons for the rise in illicit phone usage in Turkey include:\n\nHigh taxes on mobile phones in Turkey.\nHigh prices of mobile phones in Turkey.\nLack of supervision in the mobile phone market in Turkey.\n\nWorldwide:\nUnknown phone dominance globally started at a considerably high level of 8% in 2017 and decreased to around 3-4% by 2022. Some reasons for illicit phone usage worldwide include:\n\nHigh taxes on mobile phones globally.\nHigh prices of mobile phones globally.\nLack of supervision in the global mobile phone market.\n\nAnalysis and Evaluation of Data:\nThe increase in illicit phone usage in Turkey and worldwide leads to several problems:\n\nLoss of Government Revenue:\n\nHigh taxes and illicit usage contribute to significant losses in government revenue.\n\nUnfair Competition for Mobile Phone Manufacturers:\n\nThe lower cost of illicit phones creates unfair competition for legal manufacturers.\n\nConsumer Disadvantages Due to Low Quality:\n\nIllicit phones often have lower quality, leading to disadvantages for consumers in terms of performance and warranty.\n\n\nSuggested Solutions:\nTo reduce illicit phone usage and address these problems, the following measures can be taken:\n\nReducing Taxes on Mobile Phones:\n\nLowering tax rates can decrease the incentive for illicit phone usage.\n\nLowering Prices of Mobile Phones:\n\nPrice reductions can shift consumers towards legal channels and away from illicit options.\n\nIncreasing Market Supervision:\n\nEnhanced supervision and regulation of the mobile phone market can help control illicit activities.\n\n\nTaking these measures can not only reduce illicit phone usage but also mitigate the associated problems such as government revenue loss, unfair competition, and consumer dissatisfaction."
