##### Samsung's Dominance in the Turkish Market

Samsung's market share in Turkey has risen from 20% in 2010 to 40% in 2022. This signifies a strengthening position for Samsung within the Turkish market. However, the gap between Samsung's share in Turkey and globally remains substantial.

##### Samsung's Dominance in the Global Market

Globally, Samsung's market share has increased from 40% in 2010 to 60% in 2022. This further demonstrates the company's strong position in the global market, solidifying its position as the leading smartphone manufacturer.

These factors likely contribute to a less competitive environment for Samsung within the Turkish market.

#### Conclusion

The graphs reveal a consistent increase in Samsung's market share in both Turkey and the global market.

**Comparison of Unknown Phone Dominance in Turkey and Worldwide**

**Turkey:**

Unknown phone dominance in Turkey started at around 0.7% in 2017 and followed a fluctuating trend. Despite a decrease in 2019, it reached 0.5% again by 2022, indicating an increase in the use of illicit phones. The main reasons for the rise in illicit phone usage in Turkey include:

-   High taxes on mobile phones in Turkey.
-   High prices of mobile phones in Turkey.
-   Lack of supervision in the mobile phone market in Turkey.

**Worldwide:**

Unknown phone dominance globally started at a considerably high level of 8% in 2017 and decreased to around 3-4% by 2022. Some reasons for illicit phone usage worldwide include:

-   High taxes on mobile phones globally.
-   High prices of mobile phones globally.
-   Lack of supervision in the global mobile phone market.

**Analysis and Evaluation of Data:**

The increase in illicit phone usage in Turkey and worldwide leads to several problems:

1.  **Loss of Government Revenue:**
    -   High taxes and illicit usage contribute to significant losses in government revenue.
2.  **Unfair Competition for Mobile Phone Manufacturers:**
    -   The lower cost of illicit phones creates unfair competition for legal manufacturers.
3.  **Consumer Disadvantages Due to Low Quality:**
    -   Illicit phones often have lower quality, leading to disadvantages for consumers in terms of performance and warranty.

**Suggested Solutions:**

To reduce illicit phone usage and address these problems, the following measures can be taken:

1.  **Reducing Taxes on Mobile Phones:**
    -   Lowering tax rates can decrease the incentive for illicit phone usage.
2.  **Lowering Prices of Mobile Phones:**
    -   Price reductions can shift consumers towards legal channels and away from illicit options.
3.  **Increasing Market Supervision:**
    -   Enhanced supervision and regulation of the mobile phone market can help control illicit activities.

Taking these measures can not only reduce illicit phone usage but also mitigate the associated problems such as government revenue loss, unfair competition, and consumer dissatisfaction.
